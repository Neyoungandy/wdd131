            <h2>About National Theatre</h2>
            <p> The Tafawa Balewa Square, (TBS) is a 14.5-hectare (35.8-acre) ceremonial ground (originally called “Race Course”) in Lagos Island, Lagos.

                The land was provided to colonial authorities by Oba Dosunmu in 1859, who thereafter, built up the surrounding areas. The course was later demolished by the government of Yakubu Gowon to make way for Tafawa Balewa Square. In its hey days, the course hosted the Empire Day parades. The horse racing track was about seven to eight furlongs or a mile.</p>
